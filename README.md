# Memory-Game (React - native)

# Description

-> On the screen, you will have an option to select the size of the grid with 4 options - 2x2, 4x4, 6x6, 8x8 <br /><br />
-> When the user selects a grid size, the game will start with that particular size of grid. Say, 6x6 was selected then, the game starts with a grid of size 6x6 tiles. each tile will have a number hidden under it. The numbers can range from 1 to 6x6/2 = 18. We will have all the numbers from 1 to 18, each of them would occur exactly 2 times and would be arranged randomly under a tile in the grid.<br /><br />
-> When the user clicks on the tile, the number under it becomes visible. Now, the user clicks on another tile, we can have 2 scenarios-
*If the number on the second tile is different from the first tile then after displaying for 2 seconds, both the tiles become hidden again,
*If the number on the second tile is the same as the first tile then both the tiles match and become permanently visible.<br /><br />
-> The game ends when all the tiles are permanently visible.
